//<---Ch 1 Activating Strict Mode-->

"use strict";

/*
//we use strict mode to write a secure JS code
//It is important that the 'use strict' should be the first line of code otherwise it won't work, note that comment are not counted here.
//we can also activate strict mode for a specific function or a block but there is no point of doing that so let's just activate it for the whole code 
//Strict mode helps us to avoide accidental errors and bugs in our code as it ristict certain things and it also introduce visible error in developer console where in other situations JS will Fail silently

//example : 

let hasDriversLicense = false;
const passTest = true;
//Below we will intensionally omit the s in the above variable name 
if(passTest) hasDriverLicense= true;
if (hasDriversLicense) console.log("I can Drive");


//Without Strict Mode Output will be nothing
//With Strict mode Output will be this error "ReferenceError: hasDriverLicense is not defined" as you can see the one where we omitted the s that is showing undefined using var, let or const this is how we catch the error.

//Strict mode will also throw an error if we try to use a reserved keyword as a variable.. Example

const interface = 'Hello';
const private = 545;

//output : SyntaxError: Unexpected strict mode reserved word

// A team ONLY wins if it has at least DOUBLE the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!

// 1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores

Steven is still building his tip calculator, using the same rules as before: Tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above (you can check out the code from first tip calculator challenge if you need to). Use the function type you like the most. Test the function using a bill value of 100.
2. And now let's use arrays! So create an array 'bills' containing the test data below.
3. Create an array 'tips' containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from the function you created before.
4. BONUS: Create an array 'total' containing the total values, so the bill + tip.

TEST DATA: 125, 555 and 44

HINT: Remember that an array needs a value in each position, and that value can actually be the returned value of a function! So you can just call a function as array values (so don't store the tip values in separate variables first, but right in the new array) üòâ

Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!

1. Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values
2. Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')
3. Use the 'calcTip' function we wrote before (no need to repeat) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!

TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52

HINT: Call calcTip in the loop and use the push method to add values to the tips and totals arrays üòâ

4. BONUS: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a DIFFICULT challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it:
  4.1. First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0. Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the 'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values added together
  4.2. To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements)
  4.3. Call the function with the 'totals' array
